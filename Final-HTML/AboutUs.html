            <div id="deatail">
            	<p>Coffee Times opened in July of 1983 in conjunction with the opening of Lexington Coffee & Tea Co. on Regency Road. At the time we were a much smaller coffee shop, seating 15 and offering 15 Country of Origin coffees and 3 flavored coffees. We were young and immature but none the less passionate about our mission.  It’s interesting to note that we wanted to locate with Lexington Coffee and Tea Co., which the owner had started in 1981 in her garage. She knew that combining the two, in one building, would benefit them both.  Coffee Times presented a perfect “front” for Lexington Coffee & Tea’s roasting plant since they were not open to the public (visit Lexington Coffee & Tea for their back story). The down side was the location, because the roasting was light manufacturing, they had to locate in an I-1 zone, which was an unattractive location for retail.  It was a trade off that took longer to pay off but was so worth it in the long run.

            <div id="deatail">
                <p>With each bean we roast we consider its country of origin, and how best to enhance its characteristics to the fullest. This method allows us to offer lighter roasts, city roasts, and darker roasts like Vienna, French and Italian Espresso. We have been blending different roasts and country of origins together since the beginning. You will taste the difference.
